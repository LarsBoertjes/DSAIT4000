    "# Introduction\n",
    "A very important aspect of supervised and semi-supervised machine learning is the quality of the labels produced by human labelers. Unfortunately, humans are not perfect and in some cases may even maliciously label things incorrectly. In this assignment, you will evaluate the impact of incorrect labels on a number of different classifiers.\n",

    "## Dataset\n",
    "The dataset you will be using is the [Adult Income dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult). This dataset was created by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker and was used to predict whether a person's income is more/less than 50k USD based on census data."
